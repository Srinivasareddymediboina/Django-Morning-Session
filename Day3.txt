Good morning all
================
Django:
    -- django is framework using for developing Web applications.
    -- it MVC (Model View Controller)
        -- in this MVC we will split a lorge program into sub parts or sub
            programs
    -- Model --> i can write logic for related to database connections only
    --> Views --> here i can write logic for related to user representations ike
        all html files
    --> controller: here i can bulid main logic for controlleing both model and view

    --> Django follows MVT
        -- Model: here i am storing db connections
        -- View: will work like a controller(main logic)
        -- Template: in this template we will store all .html files

    -->Django Installation process:
        --> we have to install python
        --> we have to run cammnad in command propt
            i..e, pip install django
                    pip install django == 2.2.1
    --> project creation
        --> fisrt we have to choose a specific lacation
        --> from that location open commandpropt
        --> in that cmd run a cmd for creating django project
            i.e django-admin startproject projectName
            -- when i run this cmd it will generate two different files
                -- first one is folder with name of project
                    -- this folder related to admin part
                    --> __init__.py : this file tell to python consider this folder also like a python file
                    --> settings.py : in this .py file we will make all project settings
                    --> urls.py : here we will map all our urls
                                        like: https://mypage.com/register,https://mypage.com/login
                    -->wsgi.py:
                -- manage.py : this file will acts as a interface between djnago project and
                                        command prompt(it command line utility)
                                        -->using this manage.py i can run server
                                        --> using this i can exectute db connections
                                        --> i can able to open shells
                                        --> for creating user application we can use this manage.py file

                --> in cmd execetute this command to run your django application
                        i.e, python manage.py runserver

        -->app creation:
            --> for creating user app we have to run a cmmand
                i.e, python manage.py startapp app_name
                ---> it will generate few files
                        -->migrations: it will handle all db connections
                        -->__init__.py: it will convey to python to treate this app is also a python file
                        --> admin.py : by using this file we will give permision to admin to
                            access our models that means out db tables
                        --> app.py : here will weill see app info
                        -->models.py: we will write all db connections
                        --> test.py: we are using this file for testing only
                        -->views.py : it is working like a controller for controlling all navigations

               --> after creating app we have to register our app in setting.py file
